# Assault Cube Multihack

A multihack for Assault Cube that contains the following features:
- Wallhack
- ESP
- Aimbot
- Triggerbot

It also has an interactive menu that allows these features to be toggled on and off. Use the up and down arrows to change the selection and the left and right arrows to toggle the features.

This must be injected into the Assault Cube process to work. One way to do this is to use a DLL injector. Another way is to enable AppInit_DLLs in the registry.

The offsets and method to discover them are discussed in the article at: https://gamehacking.academy/lesson/5/10
